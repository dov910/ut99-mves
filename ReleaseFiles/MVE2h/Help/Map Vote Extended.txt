Advanced Installation
=====================

- If bOverrideServerPackages=True then MapVote will manage ServerPackages for
you and will automatically add the user interface package MVE2h to ServerPackages
By default bOverrideServerPackages=True but if you have set 
bOverrideServerPackages=False you will need to manually add the client package 
yourself to ServerPackages:

[Engine.GameEngine] 
ServerPackages=MVE2h


- MapVote can be installed both in mutator or server actor mode. This will 
affect the initialization order a bit. This may influence initialization of 
other mutators. Ultimately this is a choice for you to use whichever mode is
more comfortable working with. Here are some ways you can run MapVote:

    1) as server actor, edit UnrealTournament.ini add the following:

    [Engine.GameEngine]
    ServerActors=MVES.MapVote

    1) as server mutator start the server with the following:
    
    ucc server DM-Agony?mutator=MVES.MapVote

    2) single player / standalone you can run the game with arguments:

    UnrealTournament.exe CityIntro?mutator=MVES.MapVote -log


- The installation package should come with a MVE_Config.ini file. This is 
provided as a convenience of good defaults and a baseline configuration. If
you feel lost or misconfigured something, you can use it as a reference to 
set things back to good defaults. If you already have a configuration file 
make sure you don't override it when installing updates. It's also a good 
practice to keep backups of this file or to put it under version control.
